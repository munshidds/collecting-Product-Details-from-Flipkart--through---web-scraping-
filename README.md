Web Scraping
Product Details on Flipkart**

In the world of e-commerce, staying updated with the latest product information, prices, and customer reviews is crucial for both consumers and businesses. However, manually collecting this data from online platforms can be a time-consuming and tedious process. This is where web scraping comes into play.

Web scraping is the process of programmatically extracting data from websites. In this specific task, we aim to scrape product details of iPhones listed on Flipkart, one of India's leading e-commerce platforms. Flipkart provides an extensive collection of iPhone products, each with its own set of attributes such as name, price, ratings, and specifications.

Beautiful Soup is a Python library that simplifies the parsing and extraction of data from HTML and XML documents. It allows us to navigate the HTML structure of a webpage, locate specific elements, and extract the information we need.

The main objectives of this web scraping task are:

Data Collection: Using BeautifulSoup, we will send HTTP GET requests to Flipkart's iPhone product pages and retrieve the HTML content.

Data Extraction: We will parse the HTML content to locate and extract relevant data, such as product names, prices, ratings, and specifications.

Data Storage: The extracted data will be stored in an organized format, such as a Pandas DataFrame or a CSV file, for further analysis or reporting.

Automation: By automating this data collection process, we can periodically update our dataset to ensure it reflects the latest product offerings and prices on Flipkart.
